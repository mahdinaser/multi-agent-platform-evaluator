# Adaptive Platform Selection Framework

A comprehensive research framework for evaluating multi-agent AI systems in adaptive 
database platform selection. This project compares multiple agent frameworks, LLM models, 
and data processing platforms to determine optimal strategies for workload-specific 
platform selection.

## Key Features

- **5 Agent Frameworks**: MCP, LangChain, LangGraph, FastAgency, AutoGen
- **11 LLM Models**: Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, Mistral, Phi, Gemma families
- **7 Platforms**: Pandas, DuckDB, Polars, SQLite, FAISS, Annoy, Baseline
- **Tool-Augmented Decisions**: Performance history, platform comparison, specs
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: TPC-H, NYC Taxi, synthetic workloads
- **Statistical Analysis**: Confidence intervals, significance testing, regret analysis
- **Multi-Model Testing**: Automatic agent generation for each LLM model
- **Stateful Pipelines**: LangGraph for complex multi-step decisions
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: AutoGen for collaborative decision-making

## Research Contributions

- First systematic comparison of agent frameworks for system optimization
- Novel evaluation of tool-augmented LLMs (MCP) for database selection
- Comprehensive analysis of 11 LLM models (2B to 70B parameters)
- Multi-agent vs single-agent comparison study
- Stateful vs stateless decision-making analysis
